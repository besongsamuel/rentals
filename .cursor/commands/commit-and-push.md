You are acting as a careful senior engineer.

Task:

1. Verify that the project builds successfully.
   - Run the appropriate build and/or lint checks for this repository.
   - If any errors or warnings break the build, diagnose and fix them.
   - Do NOT introduce new features or refactors unless required to fix the issue.
   - Keep fixes minimal and well-scoped.

2. After the build passes with no errors:
   - Review the changes made.
   - Stage all relevant changes.
   - Create a clear, concise commit message describing what was fixed.
   - Push the commit to the current remote branch.

Constraints:

- Do not commit broken or untested code.
- Do not change unrelated files.
- If you are unsure about a fix, explain the risk before proceeding.
- Prefer correctness and stability over cleverness.

When finished:

- Confirm the build status
- Confirm the commit hash
- Confirm the branch and remote pushed to
