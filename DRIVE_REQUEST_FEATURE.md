# Drive Request Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete drive request system that allows drivers to request to drive available cars from owners, and owners to approve or reject those requests.

## Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **`car_assignment_requests`** - Main request tracking table
   - Stores driver requests to drive specific cars
   - Tracks status (pending, approved, rejected, withdrawn, expired)
   - Contains availability dates, working hours, and experience details
   - Auto-expires after 30 days if not reviewed

2. **`assignment_request_messages`** - Communication between drivers and owners
   - Threaded messaging system
   - Internal/external message flags
   - Supports parent-child message relationships

3. **`assignment_request_history`** - Audit trail
   - Tracks all status changes
   - Records who made changes and when
   - Stores metadata for compliance

### Database Functions
- `can_driver_send_request()` - Validates driver profile completion
- `expire_old_assignment_requests()` - Auto-expires old pending requests
- `log_request_status_change()` - Automatic audit logging

### RLS Policies
- Separate policies for drivers and owners
- Drivers can create, view, update, and withdraw their own requests
- Owners can view, approve, and reject requests for their cars
- Both parties can add messages to requests

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components

#### 1. **DriveRequestCard** (`src/components/DriveRequestCard.tsx`)
- Shared component for displaying request information
- Adapts UI based on user type (driver/owner)
- Shows car details, driver info, availability, and status
- Action buttons for approve/reject/withdraw/edit

#### 2. **DriveRequestDialog** (`src/components/DriveRequestDialog.tsx`)
- Form for creating and editing drive requests
- Auto-checks for existing pending requests
- Validates dates and required fields
- Handles both new requests and updates to existing ones

### New Pages

#### 1. **DriverDriveRequests** (`src/pages/DriverDriveRequests.tsx`)
- Shows all requests sent by the driver
- Tabbed interface: Pending, Approved, Other
- Withdraw functionality for pending requests
- Skeleton loading states

#### 2. **OwnerDriveRequests** (`src/pages/OwnerDriveRequests.tsx`)
- Shows all requests received by the owner
- Tabbed interface: Pending, Approved, Other
- Approve/Reject functionality with optional notes
- Skeleton loading states

### Updated Components

#### 1. **CarCard** (`src/components/CarCard.tsx`)
- Added "Request to Drive" button
- Shows button only when:
  - User is a driver with complete profile
  - Car status is "available"
  - Driver can send requests

#### 2. **CarSearch** (`src/pages/CarSearch.tsx`)
- Added profile completion check
- Shows alert if driver profile is incomplete
- Links to profile completion page

#### 3. **Header** (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- Added "Drive Requests" menu item for both drivers and owners
- Uses RequestPage icon

#### 4. **App.tsx**
- Added routes for `/drive-requests`
- Routes to correct page based on user type
- Added document title for drive requests page

### Services

#### assignmentRequestService (`src/services/assignmentRequestService.ts`)
- `canDriverSendRequest()` - Check driver eligibility
- `getExistingRequest()` - Check for existing pending request
- `createRequest()` - Create new drive request
- `updateRequest()` - Update pending request
- `withdrawRequest()` - Withdraw pending request (driver)
- `approveRequest()` - Approve request (owner)
- `rejectRequest()` - Reject request with reason (owner)
- `getDriverRequests()` - Fetch all driver's requests
- `getOwnerRequests()` - Fetch all owner's requests
- `getRequest()` - Fetch single request details
- `getRequestMessages()` - Fetch request messages
- `addMessage()` - Add message to request
- `expireOldRequests()` - Utility to expire old requests

### TypeScript Types

- `AssignmentRequestMessageWithProfile`
- `CreateAssignmentRequestMessage`

## Translations

Added complete translations for both English and French:

- Page titles and subtitles
- Form labels and helpers
- Status labels
- Error messages
- Success messages
- Confirmation dialogs
- Empty states

## User Flow

3. Click "Request to Drive" on car card
4. Fill out request form (availability, hours, notes, experience)
5. Submit request (or update existing pending request)
6. View requests on Drive Requests page
7. Can edit or withdraw pending requests
8. See approval/rejection status

### Owner Flow
1. Receive notifications of new drive requests
2. View requests on Drive Requests page
3. Review driver details, experience, and notes
