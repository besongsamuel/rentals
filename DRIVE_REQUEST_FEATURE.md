# Drive Request Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete drive request system that allows drivers to request to drive available cars from owners, and owners to approve or reject those requests.

## Database Schema

### Tables Created
1. **`car_assignment_requests`** - Main request tracking table
   - Stores driver requests to drive specific cars
   - Tracks status (pending, approved, rejected, withdrawn, expired)
   - Contains availability dates, working hours, and experience details
   - Auto-expires after 30 days if not reviewed

2. **`assignment_request_messages`** - Communication between drivers and owners
   - Threaded messaging system
   - Internal/external message flags
   - Supports parent-child message relationships

3. **`assignment_request_history`** - Audit trail
   - Tracks all status changes
   - Records who made changes and when
   - Stores metadata for compliance

### Database Functions
- `can_driver_send_request()` - Validates driver profile completion
- `expire_old_assignment_requests()` - Auto-expires old pending requests
- `log_request_status_change()` - Automatic audit logging

### RLS Policies
- Separate policies for drivers and owners
- Drivers can create, view, update, and withdraw their own requests
- Owners can view, approve, and reject requests for their cars
- Both parties can add messages to requests

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components

#### 1. **DriveRequestCard** (`src/components/DriveRequestCard.tsx`)
- Shared component for displaying request information
- Adapts UI based on user type (driver/owner)
- Shows car details, driver info, availability, and status
- Action buttons for approve/reject/withdraw/edit

#### 2. **DriveRequestDialog** (`src/components/DriveRequestDialog.tsx`)
- Form for creating and editing drive requests
- Auto-checks for existing pending requests
- Validates dates and required fields
- Handles both new requests and updates to existing ones

### New Pages

#### 1. **DriverDriveRequests** (`src/pages/DriverDriveRequests.tsx`)
- Shows all requests sent by the driver
- Tabbed interface: Pending, Approved, Other
- Withdraw functionality for pending requests
- Skeleton loading states

#### 2. **OwnerDriveRequests** (`src/pages/OwnerDriveRequests.tsx`)
- Shows all requests received by the owner
- Tabbed interface: Pending, Approved, Other
- Approve/Reject functionality with optional notes
- Skeleton loading states

### Updated Components

#### 1. **CarCard** (`src/components/CarCard.tsx`)
- Added "Request to Drive" button
- Shows button only when:
  - User is a driver with complete profile
  - Car status is "available"
  - Driver can send requests

#### 2. **CarSearch** (`src/pages/CarSearch.tsx`)
- Added profile completion check
- Shows alert if driver profile is incomplete
- Links to profile completion page

#### 3. **Header** (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- Added "Drive Requests" menu item for both drivers and owners
- Uses RequestPage icon

#### 4. **App.tsx**
- Added routes for `/drive-requests`
