    "driverA1": "Once a car is assigned to you, you have just one main responsibility: at the end of each week, enter your weekly report for the assigned car. This includes how much you made from ride share/taxi/rentals, how much you spent on maintenance and gas, how much you paid yourself, and your mileage for the week.",
    "driverQ2": "Can I communicate with the car owner?",
    "driverA2": "Yes! Both drivers and owners can add comments and messages to any specific weekly report. This allows for open communication about performance, expenses, or any concerns.",
    "driverQ3": "What if I make a mistake in my report?",
    "driverA3": "If you enter high weekly mileage, you'll need to justify the income that comes with it if it's low. The system helps maintain transparency by flagging inconsistencies between mileage and earnings.",
    "driverQ4": "How do I know which cars are more profitable for me?",
    "driverA4": "The platform provides statistics showing which cars could be more profitable for you based on your performance data. This helps you make informed decisions about which vehicles to drive.",
    "ownerQ1": "How do I get started as a car owner?",
    "ownerA1": "Getting started is simple: 1) Register a car that you own on the platform, 2) Ask your driver to register on the platform, 3) Assign your car to your driver. That's it! The platform handles the rest.",
    "ownerQ2": "How do I monitor my car's performance?",
    "ownerA2": "You have access to comprehensive statistics on how your car is performing. This includes detailed insights into profitability, usage patterns, and areas you should focus on to optimize your rental income.",
    "ownerQ3": "How does the platform keep drivers honest?",
    "ownerA3": "The system maintains transparency in several ways: if a driver enters high weekly mileage, they must justify the income that comes with it if it's low. Additionally, if a driver enters low mileage but actually drove more, this will be caught during quarterly inspections when the mileage on reports doesn't match the actual car's odometer.",
    "ownerQ4": "What kind of reports can I see?",
    "ownerA4": "You can view detailed weekly reports including driver earnings, maintenance expenses, gas costs, ride share income, rental income, taxi income, and mileage data. You can also add comments and messages to any report for better communication.",
    "transparencyTitle": "Transparency & Trust",
